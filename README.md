## Key Features

### AI Role Selection
Users can choose from four specialized AI roles, powered by the OpenAI API. Each role tailors its response to the selected purpose:

Teacher – Explains code step by step for beginners and suggests improvements.

Debugger – Identifies errors, explains why they occur, and highlights potential runtime issues.

Optimizer – Suggests performance improvements and removes unnecessary complexity.

Commenter – Automatically adds comments, explains complex logic, and helps with documentation.

To use it, users only need to:

1. Select a role

2. Insert their code

No extra setup is required—the models are ready to assist instantly.

## Code Complexity Analysis
The application includes a custom-trained Artificial Neural Network (ANN) that evaluates code complexity. Submitted code is automatically classified as Easy, Medium, or Hard.
This gives users quick feedback on their progress and helps identify areas for improvement.
